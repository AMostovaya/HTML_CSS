		<h2>Подробное описание товара:</h2>
		<p>
			The Charger was restyled for 2011, but its basic rear-drive mechanicals remained the same (all-wheel drive was available on some models). The base engine was now a 292-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6, while R/Ts ran a 370-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8; an SRT8 with a 470-hp, 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 was added for 2012. Other developments included the phasing in of an eight-speed automatic transmission beginning in 2012, touched-up styling inside and out, the addition of a crazy-fast 707-hp SRT Hellcat for 2015, and newly available Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity in 2017.
